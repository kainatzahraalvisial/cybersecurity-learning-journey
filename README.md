# Cybersecurity Learning Journey
Hi! I'm Zahra — an aspiring cybersecurity analyst / ethical hacker.

Hands-on Cybersecurity Portfolio &amp; Learning Log • Kali Linux labs • Nmap scanning • Metasploitable exploitation • Wireshark captures •  Aspiring ethical hacker documenting real labs, commands, screenshots, and key learnings.

This repository is my **personal hands-on learning log** where I document everything I practice and learn in cybersecurity.

### Current Focus
- Kali Linux basics & terminal usage  
- Network scanning & reconnaissance (mainly Nmap right now)  
- Vulnerability exploitation (starting with Metasploit)  
- Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate (in progress)

### My Learning Path (Progress Tracker)

- [x] Kali Linux Fundamentals & Terminal Practice  
- [x] First Nmap scans (Metasploitable 2)  
- [ ] Exploitation basics with Metasploit  
- [ ] Traffic analysis with Wireshark  
- [ ] Web application security labs  
- [ ] More labs coming every week!

### Labs & Write-ups
